## by Koketso Diale


## Dataset

> The Loan Data by Prosper is a finacial dataset with 81 features and 113937 entries which details records of Borrowers and assorciated information such as their financial standing, other parties such as investors and general infomation such as their Ranking which is used to determine the likelyhood of them repaying the loan on time.


## Summary of Findings

> The loan requests being made pre 2009 were underwhelming however due to a large chunk of data missing during this time period, this finding is not ideal to be included within the presentation.

> Due to a higher number of Employed Borrowers Canada has the highest frequency of Borrowers with relatively higher ProperRankings this is the reason why the state accounts for more entries than any other state listed in this dataset.

> The ProsperRating is heavily influenced and correlates to whether or not the Borrower is a home owner, the duration that the borrower has been currently employed and their available bank credit as there is a strong correlation between these features.

> Most Investor capital is distributed amongst Home Owners this may be due to the correlation between the Borrower being a Home Owner and the ProsperRating which naturally allows more home owners to get the loans.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Prospect's Rating score favors property owners, people with a stable source of income and higher credit balances, in the exploration it was thought that this was due to longer employment durations instead of employment status.

> Canada relatively has better economic conditions in this dataset as made evident by the high number of people who are employed and thus a relatively high number of loan entries.

> In the Prospect Rankings, the AA tier is the minority however they are mostly situated in Canada.
